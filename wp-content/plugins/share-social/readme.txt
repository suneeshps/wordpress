== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I did not receive an email from Cunjo with my new ID, what should I do? =

a. The first option would be to visit Social Analytics tab (or on our website here: http://cunjo.com/social-analytics/platform/) and login with the email address and password you used for registration. Once logged in you will see on the top left corner of your Dashboard your Cunjo ID, or in your account visit Account Settings page and you will see your ID displayed there.
b. If for some reason you can't access your Account submit an email to support@cunjo.com from the email used to register and write in the email subject "Retrieve my Cunjo ID". We will reply with your ID.

= I already have a Cunjo ID from cunjo.com, can I use that one? =

Yes. If you previously generated a Cunjo ID from our website you can use it on your plugin. Insert the id in the General Settings form after installation and the system will approve it.

= Can I use my Cunjo ID on multiple wordpress installations? =

Yes. Your Cunjo ID is Universal. You can Use it on as many blogs as you like.

= Can I use both the Share Bar and inline share buttons in the same time? =

Yes. With the Cunjo plugin you can use both share widget styles.

= Can I design and use more that one Cunjo Bar in the same time on a blog? =

Yes, unlike versions prior 2.0 you can now use ONE of EACH widget per page.

= The design changes don't show up on the widget on my website even dough i received confirmation messages that they were saved. Why is this happening? =

The guess would be that you have a Cache plugin enabled that shows you a history of saved content instead of fresh one in order to speed up your page's execution. In this case Flush the cache and the changes done to the widget should be visible.

= My Share bar is not showing on my blog, what might be the issue? =

The plugin is 100% built and integrated with wordpress functionalities, functions and hooks. The first guess might be that you have a buggy plugin in conflict with ours. Try to spot that plugin by deactivating each of your plugins one at a time and each time refresh your blog page, if after deactivating a plugin the Cunjo bar appears on your blog it means you found the buggy plugin. If nothing works contact the Cunjo Support team at on our User Hub hub.cunjo.com and we will take a look for you.

= How can I get more informations about Cunjo and my Cunjo account? =

If you created your account after we launched version 2.0 you have a Hub User account on Cunjo. The Cunjo Hub (http://hub.cunjo.com) is our service area for updates, knowledgebase and keeping in touch with our users.
